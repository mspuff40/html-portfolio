<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Amanda and I am currently located in Atlanta Georgia, USA. Right now, I am learing a couple of different 
  programming langues to assist me with my own projects and further growth in my career. I currently work in software 
  support for a large Saas company. As a big fan of puzzles, I enjoy and take pride in investigating and troubleshooting 
  any issues I encounter throughout my day to day. 
</p>

<p> I enjoy reading, taking my dog to the park, and watching all sorts of movies and tv shows in my free time. I also 
  love going camping and hiking with friends on the weekend, it's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of 
  everyday. </p>

<p>If you have any additional questions about me, or would like to send over any book/show/movie recommendations, please feel
  free to shoot me an email. My Contacts details can be found <a href="./contact.html">here</a> on my Contact Me page. 
  Thank for reading!
